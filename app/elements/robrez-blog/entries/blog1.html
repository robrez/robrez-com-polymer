    <h2>The urge</h2>
    "I feel like building a thing". Do you get this urge as often as I do? For me, time
    permitting, this urge is typically followed by an hour of sitting in front of
    my computer. Slowly comes a stream of thoughts... "No, not that", "Hmmm that's
    a cool idea", "nevermind, that's dumb", "I'm hungry", "that's just facebook".
    Usually this fun exercise of futility culminates in a final thought, "Screw this,
    I'm going to bed."

    <h2>The idea</h2>
    Once in a blue moon, something worthy of pursuit does pop out of the ole "hat rack".
    Now comes the real trouble, doesn't it? Does it need a database? Which one? What
    to use for the back-end code? The front-end? Oh this 3rd party library looks
    perfect.. let me just learn haskell, learn coffeescript, install it w/ npm, and
    build it with grunt (learn grunt). Maybe I should go native? "Screw this, I'm
    going to bed."
  </p>

    <h2>The gameplan</h2>
    Perhaps, after all of that, I've stayed-the-course and decided to go from idea to
    implementation. The planets have aligned; but, We're not out of the woods yet.
    At some point, somewhere inbetween a mere abstract idea and a concrete implementation,
    I somtimes gain a somewhat-complete mental image of the overall design. Sounds
    good, right? It is. Unfortunately, this mental image is often-times accompanied
    by an onset of apathy. Once a working design becomes plastered in my mind, my
    urge to create is satiated. "Screw this, I'm going to bed."
  </p>
  <p>
    <h2>The context-switch</h2>
    There's a bit of a feedback loop that can present another tricky obstacle during
    the design and implementation phase. I tend to decide, "ahh, in order to build
    foo, I need to build bar." Guess what that means? Project "bar" gets pushed on
    the stack. With any luck, "bar" gets completed and we pop back to Project "foo".
    There's going to be a pretty good chance that I never complete "bar"... especially
    when there's an equally good chance that "bar" ends up needing a "baz". One of
    my favorite XKCD comics does an excellent job of illustrating this pitfall:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://xkcd.com/974/">XKCD: The General Problem</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    <h2>The reward</h2>
    Still here? Congratualtions... you made a thing. Feels good doesn't it? The journey
    is challenging but rewarding.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometime soon I plan on writing about the mental sparring that took place in order
    to design my blog.
